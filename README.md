# SwimmingPool_CPSC304

Simple, academic project that built a database for a hypothetical swimming pool business and a rudimentary web interface.

The database is written with SQL and models information pertaining to patrons, memberships, staff members, lockers, facilities, and so on. 

The web interface allows you to search, update, and remove various types of data stored in the database.
